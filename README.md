Decent Git
Decent Git is a decentralized Git-like platform built using Web3 technologies. This project leverages blockchain and IPFS to enable secure, distributed version control for repositories, providing a robust alternative to traditional centralized platforms.

Features: 
1.)Decentralized Storage: Uses IPFS for storing and sharing repository files securely.
2.)Blockchain Integration: Smart contracts on Ethereum manage repository metadata, ownership, and access control.
3.)Private Repositories: Option to create private repositories with encrypted storage.
4.)Commit History: Immutable record of commits stored on the blockchain.
5.)User-friendly Interface: Simplified UI for uploading files, managing repositories, and collaborating.

Installation:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/decent-git.git
cd decent-git
npm install
npm run dev

Technologies Used:

Blockchain: Ethereum Smart Contracts (Solidity)
Storage: IPFS for distributed file storage
Frontend: React.js
Backend: Node.js
Web3 Integration: web3.js for blockchain interactions

Usage:
1.) Launch the application on your local environment or a deployed server.
2.)Connect your Web3 wallet (e.g., MetaMask).
3.)Create or browse repositories using the intuitive interface.
4.)Upload files and track changes securely.
